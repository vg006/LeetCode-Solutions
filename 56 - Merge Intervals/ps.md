The 56th problem on LeetCode, titled **Merge Intervals**, is a well-known algorithmic challenge that involves processing a collection of intervals to merge any that overlap. Below is a detailed breakdown of the problem, including its description, topics covered, constraints, examples, solution overview, complexities, key insights, and an explanation of a specific example.

## Problem Description

You are given an array of intervals, where each interval is represented as a pair of integers `[start_i, end_i]`. The task is to merge all overlapping intervals and return a new array of non-overlapping intervals.


## Topics Covered

- **Sorting**: The intervals need to be sorted based on their starting times to facilitate merging.
- **Greedy Algorithms**: The problem can be solved using a greedy approach to ensure that we always merge the intervals optimally.
- **Array Manipulation**: The solution involves manipulating arrays to store merged intervals.


## Constraints

- The input intervals are guaranteed to be valid, meaning they will not start after they end.
- The number of intervals can vary, but typical constraints may involve `1 <= intervals.length <= 10^4` and `0 <= start_i <= end_i <= 10^4`.


## Examples

1. **Example 1**:
    - **Input**: `[[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]`
    - **Output**: `[[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]`
    - **Explanation**: The intervals `[1,3]` and `[2,6]` overlap, so they are merged into `[1,6]`.

2. **Example 2**:
    - **Input**: `[[1,4],[4,5]]`
    - **Output**: `[[1,5]]`
    - **Explanation**: The intervals `[1,4]` and `[4,5]` are considered overlapping and are merged into `[1,5]`.


## Solution Overview

The solution involves the following steps:

1. **Sort the Intervals**: First, sort the intervals based on their starting times. This allows for easier comparison of overlapping intervals.

2. **Merge Intervals**: Iterate through the sorted intervals and merge them if they overlap. If the current interval does not overlap with the last merged interval, add it to the result.

3. **Return the Result**: After processing all intervals, return the list of merged intervals.


## Complexities

- **Time Complexity**: $$O(n \log n)`, where $$n$$ is the number of intervals. This is due to the sorting step.
- **Space Complexity**: $$O(n)` for storing the merged intervals.


## Key Insights

- Sorting the intervals is crucial as it allows for a linear scan to merge overlapping intervals efficiently.
- Overlapping intervals are defined such that if the start of one interval is less than or equal to the end of another, they overlap.


## Algorithm

1. Sort the intervals based on their start times.
2. Initialize a list to hold the merged intervals.
3. Traverse through the sorted intervals:
    - If the current interval overlaps with the last added interval in the merged list, merge them.
    - Otherwise, add the current interval as a new entry in the merged list.


## Special Cases

- Intervals that touch at the endpoints (e.g., `[1,4]` and `[4,5]`) are considered overlapping.
- If all intervals are non-overlapping, the output will be the same as the input.


## Example Explanation

For the input `[[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]`:

1. **Sorting**: The intervals remain the same after sorting since they are already in order.
2. **Merging**:
    - Start with the first interval `[1,3]`.
    - Compare it with `[2,6]`: they overlap, so merge them to form `[1,6]`.
    - Move to `[8,10]`: it does not overlap with `[1,6]`, so add `[8,10]` to the result.
    - Finally, `[15,18]` does not overlap with `[8,10]`, so add it as well.
3. **Final Output**: The merged intervals are `[[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]`.

This structured approach to the problem not only provides clarity in understanding the merging process but also highlights the importance of sorting in solving interval-related problems efficiently.
