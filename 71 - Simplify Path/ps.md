The 71st problem on LeetCode, titled **Simplify Path**, involves simplifying a Unix-style file path. This problem is commonly encountered in coding interviews and requires a good understanding of string manipulation and stack data structures. Below is a detailed breakdown of the problem, including its description, topics covered, constraints, examples, solution overview, complexities, key insights, algorithm, special cases, and an example explanation.

## Problem Description

You are given a string representing an absolute path for a Unix-style file system. The path may contain the following components:

- `.`: Refers to the current directory.
- `..`: Refers to the parent directory.
- A sequence of characters representing directory names.

The task is to simplify the given path by resolving these components and returning the canonical path.

---
## Topics Covered

- **String Manipulation**: The problem requires parsing and manipulating strings to extract directory names and resolve paths.
- **Stack Data Structure**: A stack is used to keep track of valid directory names as the path is simplified.
- **Path Normalization**: The process of converting a relative path to an absolute path.

---
## Constraints

- The input path is guaranteed to be a valid absolute path.
- The length of the input path can be up to `10^4` characters.

---
## Examples

1. **Example 1**:
    - **Input**: `"/a/./b/../../c/"`
    - **Output**: `"/c"`
    - **Explanation**: The path resolves to the directory `c` after navigating through the current and parent directories.

2. **Example 2**:
    - **Input**: `"/../"`
    - **Output**: `"/"`
    - **Explanation**: The path attempts to go to the parent of the root directory, which remains at the root.

3. **Example 3**:
    - **Input**: `"/home//foo/"`
    - **Output**: `"/home/foo"`
    - **Explanation**: The double slashes are treated as a single slash, resulting in a simplified path.

4. **Example 4**:
    - **Input**: `"/a/../../b/../c//././/.."`
    - **Output**: `"/c"`
    - **Explanation**: The path resolves to `c` after navigating through various components.

---
## Solution Overview

The solution involves parsing the input path and using a stack to keep track of the valid directory names. The algorithm processes each component of the path, handling special cases for `.` and `..`, and constructs the simplified path from the stack.

---
## Complexities

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the input string. Each character is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(k)`, where `k` is the number of valid directory names in the simplified path, which is stored in the stack.

---
## Key Insights

- The use of a stack allows for efficient management of directory names, especially when dealing with parent directory references.
- The problem can be solved in a single pass through the input string, making it efficient in terms of time complexity.

---
## Algorithm

1. **Initialization**: Start with an empty stack to hold directory names and split the input path by the `/` delimiter.
2. **Process Each Component**:
    - Skip empty components and those equal to `.`.
    - If the component is `..`, pop from the stack if it is not empty (to go up one directory).
    - Otherwise, push the component onto the stack.
3. **Construct the Result**: After processing all components, build the simplified path by joining the elements in the stack with `/`.
4. **Return the Result**: If the stack is empty, return `/`, otherwise return the constructed path.

---
## Special Cases

- **Empty Input**: If the input path is empty, the output should also be an empty string.
- **Root Directory**: If the path resolves to the root directory, the output should be `"/"`.

---
## Example Explanation

Consider the input `"/a/./b/../../c/"`:

1. **Splitting the Path**: The input is split into components: `["", "a", ".", "b", "..", "..", "c", ""]`.
2. **Processing Components**:
    - The first component is empty, so it is ignored.
    - The second component is `a`, which is pushed onto the stack.
    - The third component is `.`, which is ignored (current directory).
    - The fourth component is `b`, which is pushed onto the stack.
    - The fifth component is `..`, which pops `b` from the stack (moving up).
    - The sixth component is `..`, which pops `a` from the stack (moving up again).
    - The seventh component is `c`, which is pushed onto the stack.
    - The last component is empty, so it is ignored.
3. **Building the Result**: The stack now contains `["c"]`. The final path is constructed as `"/c"`.

**Output**: `"/c"`

This structured approach effectively simplifies the Unix-style path while handling various edge cases and ensuring the correct format of the output.
