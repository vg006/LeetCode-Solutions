## Problem Description

The LeetCode problem **Minimum Size Subarray Sum** (Problem 209) requires finding the minimal length of a contiguous subarray of which the sum is greater than or equal to a given target. If no such subarray exists, the function should return `0`.


## Problem Statement

Given an array of positive integers `nums` and a positive integer `target`, the task is to determine the length of the smallest contiguous subarray whose sum is at least `target`.


## Topics Covered

- Sliding Window Technique
- Two-pointer Technique
- Array Manipulation
- Prefix Sums


## Constraints

- The length of `nums` can be up to 10^5.
- Each element in `nums` is a positive integer, and `target` is also a positive integer.


## Examples

1. **Example 1:**
    - **Input:** `target = 7`, `nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]`
    - **Output:** `2`
    - **Explanation:** The subarray `[4,3]` has the minimal length of `2` and a sum of `7`.

2. **Example 2:**
    - **Input:** `target = 4`, `nums = [1,4,4]`
    - **Output:** `1`
    - **Explanation:** The subarray `[4]` has the minimal length of `1` and a sum of `4`.

3. **Example 3:**
    - **Input:** `target = 11`, `nums = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]`
    - **Output:** `0`
    - **Explanation:** There is no subarray that meets the requirement.


## Solution Overview

The solution to the Minimum Size Subarray Sum problem can be effectively implemented using the sliding window technique. This approach allows us to maintain a dynamic range of elements that can be expanded or contracted based on the current sum relative to the target.

### Steps Involved

1. **Initialize Variables:** Use two pointers to represent the start and end of the current subarray, a variable to store the current sum, and a variable to track the minimum length of valid subarrays found.

2. **Expand the Window:** Use a loop to expand the window by moving the end pointer and adding the corresponding element to the current sum.

3. **Contract the Window:** Whenever the current sum is greater than or equal to the target, attempt to contract the window from the start by moving the start pointer to the right, updating the minimum length whenever a valid subarray is found.

4. **Return Result:** If a valid subarray was found, return its length; otherwise, return `0`.

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The overall time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of elements in `nums`. Each element is processed at most twice (once by the end pointer and once by the start pointer).

- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is O(1), as we are using a constant amount of extra space for variables.


## Key Insights

- The sliding window technique is particularly effective for problems involving contiguous subarrays, allowing for efficient updates to the sum and length without needing to recompute sums from scratch.
- The approach is optimal for large input sizes, making it suitable within the constraints provided.


## Special Cases

- If the input array is empty or if no subarray meets the target, the function should return `0`.
- The algorithm should handle cases where the target is less than the smallest element in the array, ensuring that it returns `0` in such scenarios.


## Example Explanation

Consider the input `target = 7` and `nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]`.

1. **Initialization:** Set pointers `start = 0`, `end = 0`, and `current_sum = 0`. Initialize `min_length` to a large value.

2. **Expand the Window:**
    - Move `end` to `0`: `current_sum = 2`.
    - Move `end` to `1`: `current_sum = 5`.
    - Move `end` to `2`: `current_sum = 6`.
    - Move `end` to `3`: `current_sum = 8` (now greater than `7`).

3. **Contract the Window:**
    - Since `current_sum >= target`, update `min_length = min(min_length, end - start + 1) = 4` (subarray `[2,3,1,2]`).
    - Move `start` to `1`: `current_sum = 6` (not valid).
    - Move `start` to `2`: `current_sum = 5` (not valid).
    - Move `start` to `3`: `current_sum = 4` (not valid).
    - Move `start` to `4`: `current_sum = 3` (not valid).
    - Move `end` to `4`: `current_sum = 7` (now valid).
    - Update `min_length = min(min_length, end - start + 1) = 2` (subarray `[4,3]`).

4. **Final Result:** The minimum length of a subarray with a sum of at least `7` is `2`, corresponding to the subarray `[4,3]`.

This example illustrates how the sliding window technique efficiently finds the desired subarray length while dynamically adjusting the window size.
