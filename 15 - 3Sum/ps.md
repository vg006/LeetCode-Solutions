## Problem Description

The LeetCode problem **3Sum** (Problem 15) requires finding all unique triplets in a given integer array `nums` that sum to zero. The goal is to return all triplets `[nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]]` such that:

- The indices `i`, `j`, and `k` are all different.
- The sum of the triplet equals zero: $$ nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] = 0 $$.
- The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.


### Topics Covered

- Array manipulation
- Sorting
- Two-pointer technique
- Handling duplicates


### Constraints

- The input array `nums` can contain between 0 and 3000 elements.
- Each element in `nums` can range from -10^9 to 10^9.


## Examples

1. **Example 1:**
   - **Input:** `nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4]`
   - **Output:** `[[-1, -1, 2], [-1, 0, 1]]`
   - **Explanation:** The valid triplets that sum to zero are `[-1, -1, 2]` and `[-1, 0, 1]`.

2. **Example 2:**
   - **Input:** `nums = []`
   - **Output:** `[]`
   - **Explanation:** No triplets can be formed from an empty array.

3. **Example 3:**
   - **Input:** `nums = [0, 1, 1]`
   - **Output:** `[]`
   - **Explanation:** No triplet sums to zero since all numbers are non-negative.


## Solution Overview

The solution to the 3Sum problem typically involves the following steps:

1. **Sort the Input Array:** Sorting the array helps in efficiently finding triplets and managing duplicates.

2. **Iterate with a Fixed Element:** Loop through the array, fixing one element at a time and using a two-pointer approach to find pairs that sum to the negative of the fixed element.

3. **Using Two Pointers:** For each fixed element, initialize two pointersâ€”one at the beginning of the remaining elements and one at the end. Adjust these pointers based on the sum of the triplet until all possible pairs are checked.

4. **Avoiding Duplicates:** After finding a valid triplet, move the pointers past any duplicate elements to ensure that the same triplet is not counted multiple times.


## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The overall time complexity is `O(n^2)` due to the nested iteration (one for fixing the element and another for the two-pointer search).

- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is `O(1)`  if we ignore the space used for the output list, as the algorithm primarily operates in-place.


## Key Insights

- **Sorting is Crucial:** Sorting the array simplifies the process of finding pairs and managing duplicates.

- **Two-Pointer Technique:** This method is efficient for reducing the time complexity compared to a brute-force approach.

- **Handling Duplicates:** Careful management of duplicate entries ensures that the solution set contains only unique triplets.


## Algorithm Steps

1. **Sort the Array:** Start by sorting the array to facilitate the two-pointer method and to easily skip duplicates.

2. **Fix One Element:** Iterate through the sorted array. For each element, treat it as the fixed element.

3. **Initialize Two Pointers:** Set one pointer to the next element after the fixed element and the other pointer to the end of the array.

4. **Calculate the Sum:**
   - If the sum of the fixed element and the two pointers equals zero, record the triplet.
   - If the sum is less than zero, move the left pointer to the right to increase the sum.
   - If the sum is greater than zero, move the right pointer to the left to decrease the sum.

5. **Skip Duplicates:** After finding a valid triplet, increment or decrement the pointers to skip over any duplicate values.

6. **Repeat:** Continue this process until all elements have been considered as a fixed element.


## Special Cases

- An empty array or an array with fewer than three elements should return an empty list.

- Arrays with all positive or all negative numbers cannot yield any triplets that sum to zero.


## Example Explanation

Consider the array `nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4]`.

1. **Sort the Array:** After sorting, `nums` becomes `[-4, -1, -1, 0, 1, 2]`.

2. **Iterate through the Array:** Fix the first element at index `0` which is `-4`. Use two pointers:
   - Left pointer starts at index `1` (value `-1`).
   - Right pointer starts at index `5` (value `2`).

3. **Calculate the Sum:**
   - Sum =  -4 + (-1) + 2 = -3  (move left pointer right).
   - Sum =  -4 + 0 + 2 = -2  (move left pointer right).
   - Sum =  -4 + 1 + 2 = -1  (move left pointer right).
   - Since the left pointer exceeds the right pointer, move to the next fixed element.

4. **Continue for Other Fixed Elements:** Repeat the process for `-1` at index `1`:
   - Left pointer starts at index `2` (value `-1`).
   - Right pointer starts at index `5` (value `2`).
   - Sum =  -1 + (-1) + 2 = 0  (valid triplet found: `[-1, -1, 2]`).
   - Move pointers to avoid duplicates and continue checking.

5. **Collect Unique Triplets:** The valid triplets found are `[-1, -1, 2]` and `[-1, 0, 1]`.

By following this approach, all unique triplets that sum to zero can be efficiently found.
