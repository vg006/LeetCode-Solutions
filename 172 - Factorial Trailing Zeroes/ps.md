## Problem Description

The LeetCode problem **Factorial Trailing Zeroes** (Problem 172) requires finding the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of a given integer `n`.

The factorial of a number `n` is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`. For example, `5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120`.


## Topics Covered

- Mathematical Analysis
- Factorial Computation
- Trailing Zeroes Counting


## Constraints

- The input integer `n` is guaranteed to be in the range `[0, 10^4]`.


## Examples

1. **Example 1:**
    - **Input:** `n = 3`
    - **Output:** `0`
    - **Explanation:** `3! = 6`, no trailing zero.

2. **Example 2:**
    - **Input:** `n = 5`
    - **Output:** `1`
    - **Explanation:** `5! = 120`, one trailing zero.

3. **Example 3:**
    - **Input:** `n = 0`
    - **Output:** `0`
    - **Explanation:** `0! = 1`, no trailing zero.


## Solution Overview

The solution to the Factorial Trailing Zeroes problem involves analyzing the prime factorization of the factorial. Trailing zeroes in a factorial are primarily contributed by the factors of 10, which are the product of 2 and 5.

Since the number of factors of 2 is always greater than or equal to the number of factors of 5, the number of trailing zeroes is determined by the number of factors of 5 in the factorial.
Certainly! Let's delve deeper into the solution for the LeetCode problem **Factorial Trailing Zeroes** (Problem 172) and explain how the algorithm works step-by-step.


## Counting Factors of 5

To count the number of trailing zeroes in `n!`, we can use the following approach:

1. **Count how many multiples of 5 are there in the numbers from 1 to `n`.** Each multiple of 5 contributes at least one factor of 5.
2. **Count how many multiples of 25 are there.** Each multiple of 25 contributes an additional factor of 5 (since` 25 = 5^2`).
3. **Count how many multiples of 125 are there.** Each multiple of 125 contributes yet another factor of 5 (since` 125 = 5^3`).
4. **Continue this process** until `` 5^k `` where `` 5^k > n ``.


## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The time complexity is ` O(log n) `, as we need to iterate through the factors of 5 up to `n`.

- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is ` O(1) ` since we only use a constant amount of extra space.


## Key Insights

- The number of trailing zeroes in a factorial is determined by the number of factors of 5, as there are always more factors of 2 than factors of 5.
- We can efficiently count the number of factors of 5 by repeatedly dividing `n` by 5 and summing the results.


## Algorithm

1. **Initialize a variable `count` to 0.**
2. **While `n` is greater than 0:**
    - **Divide `n` by 5 and add the result to `count`.**
    - **Update `n` to be the integer division of `n` by 5.**
3. **Return `count`.**


## Special Cases

- If `n` is 0, the function should return 0, as 0! = 1 has no trailing zeroes.
- If `n` is negative, the function should return 0, as the factorial is not defined for negative numbers.


## Example Explanation

Let's consider the example where `n = 25`.

1. **Initialization:** `count = 0`.

2. **Iteration 1:** `n = 25`, `count = 0 + 25 // 5 = 5`.

3. **Iteration 2:** `n = 5`, `count = 5 + 5 // 5 = 6`.

4. **Iteration 3:** `n = 1`, `count = 6 + 1 // 5 = 6`.

5. **Return `count = 6`.**

The factorial of 25 is `25! = 15511210043330985984000000`, which has 6 trailing zeroes. The algorithm efficiently computes this by counting the number of factors of 5 in the factorial.
